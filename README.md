# DRM-Base-UI
## TODO
### UI
**make it dark mode as default**
- [ ] Login page (with ID only)
- [ ] Gallary page (contains the current available books/videos in a grid format, when clicked in file it should start downloading with visible progress bar)
- [ ] Library page (contains downloaded books/videos and when clicked opens the book/video in the viewer)
- [ ] Downloads page (shows history of downloading and current downloading file)
- [ ] viewer page (leave it empty since it's application specific)
